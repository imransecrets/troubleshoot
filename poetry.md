It seems like you're encountering a couple of issues related to PowerShell script execution policies and the configuration of Poetry virtual environments.

Script Execution Policy Error:
The error message "File ... cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system" suggests that your PowerShell script execution policy doesn't allow running scripts. This is a security feature in PowerShell. To fix this, you need to change the execution policy. You can do this by opening PowerShell as an administrator and running the following command:

javascript
Copy code
`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
This command allows running scripts that you've written or obtained from trusted sources.

Invalid Value Error for Poetry Virtual Environment Configuration:
The error "True" is an invalid value for virtualenvs. create indicates that Poetry 
is expecting a different format or value for the configuration. The correct value should be either true or false, without quotes.

To set up Poetry to create virtual environments automatically, you can use:

lua
Copy code
`poetry config virtualenvs.create true`
Ensure that you run this command in a PowerShell session where script execution policies allow script execution.

After performing these steps, you should be able to create Poetry virtual environments without encountering errors related to script execution policies or invalid configuration values.
